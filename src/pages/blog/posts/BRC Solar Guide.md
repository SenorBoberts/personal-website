## Intro

Let me guess, you clicked on this article because you're wondering if you can run an air conditioner with a solar panel. I'll save you the read, the answer is *probably* no. But Wait! Don't click away just yet. Just because you can't air condition your uninsulated Coleman tent for ten dollars doesn't mean that you can't make your life on the Playa far more luxurious with surprisingly little time, effort, and money. 

## Background

I'm not an expert on solar, electrical systems, or anything really. I'm just a twenty-two year old burner who just graduated college. However, almost twenty-four months ago I was sitting in your shoes. For my first burn in 2022 I had camped with a theme camp with elaborate infrastructure. They ran two gigantic generators and managed to air condition many many shiftpods. For my second burn my camp was much smaller and I wasn't willing to step back to fully roughing it. 

I wanted some power and I wanted it to be green. Generators are noisy, heavy, expensive, require fuel storage, and worst of all (at least to me) smell awful. Solar is silent, odorless, requires little upkeep once its set up, and is far better for the planet, my lungs, and my nose. 

I wanted at least enough power to charge devices and lights, and power a box fan for my shelter. I find it hard to sleep in the heat so this was an essential for me. My camp mates and I also settled on a more ambitious plan, powering a fifteen cubic foot chest freezer. 

In order to make this happen I scoured the internet. Watched numerous YouTube tutorials, read forums and other solar guides available, and went through some plain old trial and error. Now I've compiled this guide so you don't have to sift through the mountains of information from van lifers to residential builders.  

Spoiler alert it ended up working out, but more on our setup later. The chest freezer enables us to keep a wealth of frozen food available without any maintenance. This enabled us to keep things like vacuum sealed and frozen rib eye steaks for when we really wanted to have paradise on the Playa. However, that isn't all. We also keep frozen Gatorade bottles, gallon water jugs, and bags of ice in the freezer which we used to manage an ice chest of cold (but not frozen) food and another of ice cold drinks. All of this without a single trip to Arctica. During the mud-pocalypse of 2023 we were sipping cold champagne as we feasted on our wealth of fresh food and in 2024 we were gifting bags of ice to our neighbors to save them the trouble. 

This is our dream become reality but electricity is truly flexible. Think up whatever would make your life drastically better. Whatever will free your time at Burning Man to do the more important things. If this sounds like a journey you want to embark on then keep reading. 

## Step 1: Scope and Planning

The first and possibly most important step is to scope your project. What things are you trying to power and for how long? There is a huge gap between I want to charge my phone and I want to run a microwave. Similarly there is a big difference between I want to run star link for an hour a day and running it twenty-four seven. Are there things that are nice to have but not essential and can be run only when the batteries are full and the sun is out? 

A logical first step is write out on paper the things you want to power, for how long, and their priority. This will allow you to properly size your setup to your needs. 

### DIY or Buy

The time required to put together a bespoke solar system from parts may not be ideal for everyone. Especially when you factor in the forgettable aspects of the process like how to mount and store all the components. There is no shame in buying a ready made solar generator from one of the major manufacturers.

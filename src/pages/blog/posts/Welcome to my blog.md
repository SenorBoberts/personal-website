## Welcome?

Nice to meet you? Seems strange to write to a person reading an article. I'm not sure how to do an introductory post to a blog. Truth be told I just need a post to appear on this page so it's not empty so I'm writing this. 

## What is this thing?

It's just a place for me to post whatever I decide to unleash on the world. From guides and tutorials to rants and diatribes, who knows what I'll write. I might even do poetry. Ooooooo *spooky*. Prepare for whatever comes out of the bucket of neurons upstairs.

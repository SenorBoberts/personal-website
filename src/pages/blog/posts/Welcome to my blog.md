## Welcome?

Nice to meet you? Seems strange to write to a person reading an article. I'm not sure how to do an introductory post to a blog. Truth be told I just need a post to appear on this page so it's not empty. So I'm writing this. Here it is in all its shining glory for all the world (or realistically no one) to see. 

## What is this thing?

It's just a place for me to post whatever I decide to unleash on the world. From guides and tutorials to rants and diatribes, who knows what I'll write. I might even do home recipes or god forbid, poetry. Ooooooo *spooky*. Prepare for whatever comes out of the bucket of neurons upstairs. 

## This site

This site was made by me using the Astro framework. All these blog posts are rendered from markdown which is pretty cool. When my friend from school first showed me an Astro website I was predisposed to think it was stupid. I mean the name isn't my favorite and something about an orange language analytics color on GitHub is a real turn off. But I came to learn that its actually a very nice framework and thus built this site in it. 

## Well that seems like enough

If you've reached this point, in what is hopefully eventually a substantial number of posts, I guess you really liked my work. I hope the randomness of this post made you smile just a little bit. Alright that's enough for now.
